Architecture Design Decisions

Message techniques: REST APIs, gRPC and Kafka.

Using rest api for passing data from the client app because:
    - Simplicity: REST API follows a simple and intuitive design, making it easy to understand and implement.

Using gRPC for passing data from the mobile devices because:
    - Performance: gRPC is known for its high performance and low latency. 

Using Kafka handle the ingested location data. 
    - Decoupling of Producers and Consumers: 
    Kafka enables loose coupling between producers and consumers. 
    Producers can produce data without worrying about who consumes it, and consumers can consume data without worrying about who produces it. 
    This decoupling allows for flexibility and scalability in the system architecture.
