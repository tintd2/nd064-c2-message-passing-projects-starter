Architecture Design Decisions

Message techniques: REST APIs, gRPC and Kafka.

Using rest API for passing data from the client app because:
    - REST was chosen because it is the most straightforward form of message passing that does not introduce unnecessary complexity into our solution.
    - Rest API is easy to implement
    - Save cost and development time are minimized.

Using gRPC for passing data from the mobile devices because:
    - This will aid in ensuring that our solution can handle the large volume of location data that will sent from numerous mobile devices.

Using Kafka handles the ingested location data. 
    - The location producer service utilizes a message queue (Kafka) to handle the ingested location data. 
    - This will help to achieve improved performance and improved reliability and also enable the decoupling of our systems.
    - The decision to use Kafka over other messaging queues is to ensure that we utilize a durable distributed queue that can handle large volumes of data.
