# Flask Starter
This is a bare-bones Flask application that showcases how simple it can be to set up a REST API. It also serves as a starter template for users to begin experimenting with writing their own REST API endpoints.

Flask applications can look very different depending on how they are structured and implemented. This application is built to have the minimum number of dependencies to run.

## Running the app
`python3 -m venv kafka-starter`
`source kafka-starter/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python3 app.py`
